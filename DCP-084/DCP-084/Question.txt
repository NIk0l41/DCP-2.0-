Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix.
A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

For example, this matrix has 4 islands.

    0 1 2 3 4
   ----------
0 | 1 0 0 0 0
1 | 0 0 1 1 0
2 | 0 1 1 0 0
3 | 0 0 0 0 0
4 | 1 1 0 0 1
5 | 1 1 0 0 1
